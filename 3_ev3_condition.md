# Status and overall condition of the plaform

<!--
TODO:
estado actual del robot y sistema de control.
-->
One of the most important aspects before working with a robot such as this, is to identify the current state of the equipment. For this special case, the following was checked:

* Robot chassis.
* Motors.
* Control system.
* Sensors (physical conditions).

The team did a general check up of the ***Lego EV3***, the porpouse of the general check up was identify each section of the robot. In the next image, the reader of this repositorie could apreciate the general condition of ***Lego EV3***.

In the inspection, the EV3 was classified as a ***mobile robot with differential drive wheels with one free wheel***. This differential traction means that the control system allows the independent movement of each of the wheels, thus guaranteeing the description of different trajectories on the plane.
The next step in the review was to verify the physical state of each part of the robot.

## Chassis condition

The structure of the Lego EV3 appears to be in good condition, all Lego pieces are well placed and the robot build looks stable. Likewise, the elements such as traction wheels, free wheel, gyroscope, color sensor, ultrasound sensor and bumper sensor looks in good condition.

## Wheels and suspension mechanism condition.

Both differential drive wheels are in optimal conditions; through visual inspection, no deviations or wear are observed.

## Control system, power supply and move.
The system control panel and battery are physically in good condition. All the sensors were verified using the EV3 block.
